### Pedro Pires

#### Last Week Goals

- Work with other members on the communication of the app with the database.

#### Progress & Issues

- Finalized database design with table relations and made a document with more
  detail on how it works as well as guidelines for the other members to follow
  when performing any actions.
- Finished classes for the web app so we can have a more standardized way of
  working with data records across the app.
- Finished the design for the profile and create a group page on figma.
- This week I was not able to put as much time as I had hoped for into the
  project because I had a midterm that I needed to study for.

#### Future Goals

- Finish a working prototype of the chat function.
- Work with other members to have all of the actions on the database working
  correctly (since it is a noSQL database, so it is trickier on insertion and
  deletion).
