# PROVIDERS

## Why this folder?

- Add different React.js Providers in this folder. Things like UserStatus,
  Theme, and other such common settings go inside the providers.

## Conventions inside this folder

- Name your components as `<Name>Provider.js` (replace Name with something
  meaningful representing that data).
