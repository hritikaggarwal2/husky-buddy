# PROVIDERS

## Why this folder?

- Add different test suites in this folder.

## Conventions inside this folder

- Name your components as `<check_something>.test.js` (lowercase, separated with
  underscore if needed).
- There is a special file `test_constants.js` that contains some constants that
  will come in handly across files. Things file fixed timeouts, file location
  etc. If you find/write any such common constants, feel free to add them to
  this file.
