# ASSETS

## Why this folder?

- Add images, videos, logos, and all other external sources in this folder.

## Conventions inside this folder

- Create a separate folder for the each type of asset. For example the images
  should all be contained in a single folder like `assets/images/`.
- Name your components as `my_image.png` (lowercase, separated with underscore
  if needed)
